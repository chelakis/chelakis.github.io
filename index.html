    <h2><a name="BusinessPlan">Business Plan Analysis</a></h2>
    <p class="high">The Business Plan Presentation event is one of the three static events at Formula Student competitions.
      The objective of the BPP is to evaluate the team’s ability to develop and deliver a comprehensive business model which demonstrates their product – a prototype race car – could become
      a rewarding business opportunity.
      The judges are treated as if they were potential investors or partners for the presented business model.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3> The Idea</h3>
    <img src="img/scan-to-race.jpg" height="250px">
    <br>
    <p class="high">The idea of our BPP is to provide an electric racecar to the tracks which can be used by anyone with the use of a mobile app.
      In the world where the terms 'leasing' and 'renting' are becoming more and more popular, our company would bring these ideas to the karting industry.
      Users can download the app, book their race, compete with friends, join a large community and pay with just a tap.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
  <h3>Business Model</h3>
  <img src="img/business-model.jpg" width="500px">
  <br>
    <p class="high">Our company manufacture and owns the racecars which are given to the tracks to operate for a fixed term.
      Tracks are responsible for managing charging and guaranteeing the safety of the racers. Maintenance & support is covered by our company.
      Racers use and pay for our racecars through the app. Tracks are paid for their services by a percentage of the income.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3> The Application</h3>

          <video src="C4D/BPP Factory Video.mp4"  width="50%" height=auto controls preload></video>
          <br>
          <br>
    <p class="high">Our factory will be a modern production facility based on simplicity and efficiency.
      During the manufacturing process the car passes from numerous departments where all the specialized work is made.
      The U-Shaped assembly line guarantees maximum flexibility, ergonomics and better allocation of work while with the addition of more workers we can produce more cars at the same facility.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Production Management</h3>
    <img width="70%" src="Presentation%20Files/GANNTDIAGRAM1.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="high">For each unit production, each department has some specified preparatory out-of-the-vehicle work to do that does not require the vehicle (e.g. front wing assembly) and some in-the-vehicle work which require work on the vehicle.
      In order to achieve the maximum efficiency of allocation of work both outside and inside the racecar, a project management study has been made using Gannt charts.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Product Lifecycle</h3>
    <img width="300px" src="Presentation%20Files/lifecycle.jpg">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="high">All products have a life cycle.
      Older, long-established products eventually become less popular, while in contrast, the demand for new, more modern goods usually increases quite rapidly after they are launched.
      Cars have usually short product life cycle as new models with new technologies come to the market. From the other side if we see our business model as a whole, leasing is still in the introduction stage and renting assets instead of owning them is the new trend all over the world.
      Introducing race car leasing to tracks is the next step to the kart and racing industry and has a lot of potential into the future.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Environmental Footprint</h3>
    <img width="600px" src="Presentation%20Files/wtw.jpg">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="high">Although electric vehicles are considered environmentally friendly, the lifecycle environmental impacts of electric cars are a topic of increasing controversy.
      In fact, despite there are no Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions directly attributed to the vehicle,
      the total CO2 emission of electric vehicle depends on the share of renewables in the grid, from which the traction batteries are charged.
      Through a comprehensive study on our car's total emissions, we will select four countries each of which depends heavily on a particular type of energy, namely coal (Germany), nuclear energy (France), natural gas (Italy) and renewable energy (Sweden) in their energy mix.

    <p class="high"> The more renewable sources that power the grid, the lesser the emission of GHGs.
      But even in countries that produce their electricity with a lot of GHG emissions, electric racecars produce less GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion car. </p>

      The video above is a virtual assembly of the racecar which was shown at the Design Reveal event of our 4th racecar, Thetis.
      The scope of this video is to show how the racecar is made and to make clear where its part that was shown at the presentation is situated in the racecar. </p>
    <p class="high">Apart from the videos for the presentation, I made also videos for the final peresentation at the Formula Student competitions.
      In these videos, I gave extra attention to the final detail and the car is shown with its final colors and design.
