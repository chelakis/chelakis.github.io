    <p class="high">The Business Plan Presentation event is one of the three static events at Formula Student competitions.
      The objective of the BPP is to evaluate the team’s ability to develop and deliver a comprehensive business model which demonstrates their product – a prototype race car – could become
      a rewarding business opportunity.
      The judges are treated as if they were potential investors or partners for the presented business model.

    <p class="high">As part of the Marketing Team, part of my job was to create content that will make our presentations more realistic and comprehensive to the audience.
      The video above is a virtual assembly of the racecar which was shown at the Design Reveal event of our 4th racecar, Thetis.
      The scope of this video is to show how the racecar is made and to make clear where its part that was shown at the presentation is situated in the racecar. </p>
    <p class="high">Apart from the videos for the presentation, I made also videos for the final peresentation at the Formula Student competitions.
      In these videos, I gave extra attention to the final detail and the car is shown with its final colors and design.
      Below you can see the car presentation video with which we introduced our product to the judges and by clicking <a href="#factory">here</a>, you can check the virtual tour of our virtual factory and assembly line</p>
